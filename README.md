            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Just a simplified version of the Mini Banking system.</p>
            <p>In the data storage aspect, I aim to enhance the program's performance by minimizing the frequency of saving data. <br>
                To achieve this, I introduced a 'refresh' function and opted to save data only at the very end.</p>
